## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid

### What I learned

Thi project has been built with HTML and CSS, but this time working with the professional tool **Figma**. It has been a little difficult but I've never worked with Figma. This tool seems very powerful tool to create the entire or parts of the web page design.

I've add _tabindex_ attributes to improve accessibility for keyboard users that need to use it.

```html
<section class="content">
	<div class="category" tabindex="0">
		<p class="learning">Learning</p>
	</div>
	<p class="publish-date" tabindex="0">Published 21 Dec 2023</p>
	<h1 class="title" tabindex="0">HTML & CSS foundations</h1>
	<p class="description" tabindex="0">
		These languages are the backbone of every website, defining structure,
		content, and presentation.
	</p>
</section>
```

And then I write some lines in css to stylize the elements when they are focussed or hovered

```css
*:focus {
	border: 1px solid var(--yellow);
}
.content *:not(:first-child):hover,
.author-name:hover {
	cursor: pointer;
	color: var(--yellow);
}
```

### Continued development ðŸ§ ðŸš€

I want to focussed in learning to improve my _CSS_ and useful _HTML_ labels and attributes to do my pages more well-structured.

I also want to practice _Javascript_ and starting learn _React_.
